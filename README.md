# Note : This is a rough prototype. The actual product is not authorized to be made public

# Accessing the website :

- The code has been deployed on : https://manda-event.netlify.app/#/
- If you still want to run the code :
    1. npm install
    2. npm start

# Purpose :

- A high level view of the Project is to explore these ideas of event
segmentation and their effects from the point of view of senior citizens.
It is to essentially test whether the ability to parse flow of action and
break daily life experiences into chunks to absorb it deteriorates with
age.
- The objective is to use an application that is able to record daily life
experiences of its users, by clicking images on short intervals. The
application must be able to summarize them by using various
segmentation algorithms.
